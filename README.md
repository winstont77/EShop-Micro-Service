    <pre>
          As time goes by, the MVC architecture seems no longer to be the best choice for high traffic and high concurrency. In an era that emphasizes agile development, microservices have emerged accordingly. To gain a more practical understanding of microservices, I directly created a microservices project to personally experience the advantages and disadvantages of microservices.

          This project will use e-commerce to demonstrate microservices. In daily life, e-commerce is a very relevant topic. Especially during special holidays, e-commerce websites often face several times the usual traffic and concurrency. Therefore, I personally believe that e-commerce is an excellent research subject.
